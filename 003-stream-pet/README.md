# Episode 3 Stream Pet
The stream pet is a basic sample showing how to create a custom control with custom bi-drectional data between the control and game client.

The `game-client` folder contains a client to run on the streamers computer based off of the Mixer Minimal Game Client. `stream-pet-control` contains the custom control. Open this in the Control Development Kit.

## Getting Started
```
cd stream-pet-control
npm i

cd game-client
npm i
npm run start
```
